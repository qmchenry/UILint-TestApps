# UILint-TestApps
UI obstacle courses to evaluate UILint

This iOS application is integrated with [UILint](https://github.com/qmchenry/UILint) and currently provides a single view (that looks really, really lovely) that puts UILint through its paces.

For ease of development, the demo app contained in this repository is not connected to UILint with a Swift Package Manager dependency. To use this app for testing UILint, clone [UILint](https://github.com/qmchenry/UILint) in the same directory as this repository. Once development stabilizes a bit, this app will switch to using Swift PM.
